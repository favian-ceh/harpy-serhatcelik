# Examples

> Active scanning for common IP addresses in fast mode
```
# harpy -f
```

> Passive scanning on eth0
```
# harpy -i eth0 -p
```

> Scan a fixed range with a count value of 2
```
# harpy -r 192.168.0.1/24 -c 2
```

> Scan some fixed ranges with filtering
```
# harpy -r 172.16.0.1/16 10.0.0.1/8 -F
```
